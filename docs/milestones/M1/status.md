# M1 — Implementation Status

**Milestone status:** IMPLEMENTATION READY

## Current step

```text
M1-S00 — Clean-slate project bootstrap and quality/test runtime
```

**Step status:** READY TO START

## Authoritative baseline

M1 implementation proceeds from the following frozen/ratified authorities:

```text
docs/milestones/M1/contract.md
    FINAL / FROZEN

docs/milestones/M1/architecture/README.md
    FROZEN global architecture baseline

docs/milestones/M1/steps.md
    implementation decomposition approved for freeze

docs/general/technology_baseline.md
    STACK-01..STACK-09 ratified

AGENTS.md
    repository-level operating contract for coding agents
```

Before each implementation step, the mandatory pre-flight defined by `AGENTS.md`, `docs/general/linee_guida_progetto.md` and the step itself must be executed against the current normative repository documents.

```

## Current blockers

None known.

A newly discovered contradiction in frozen architecture is not an implementation blocker to work around: the affected work stops and follows the explicit architecture reopen/revalidate/propagate/re-freeze process.

## Operational rule

This file records operational progress only. It does not redefine milestone scope, architecture, technology choices or step semantics.

A step moves to `COMPLETED` only when its implementation, applicable quality gates, required PostgreSQL/API/concurrency verification and documentation coherence satisfy the exit criteria in `steps.md`.
